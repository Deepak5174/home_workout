                        Shiva gazed at the orange sky. The clouds hovering above Mansarovar had just parted to
                        reveal the setting sun. The brilliant giver of life was calling it a day once again. Shiva had seen a
                        few sunrises in his twenty-one years. But the sunset! He tried never to miss the sunset! On any
                        other day, Shiva would have taken in the vista — the sun and the immense lake against the
                        magnificent backdrop of the Himalayas stretching as far back as the eye could see. But not
                        today.
                        He squatted and perched his lithe, muscular body on the narrow ledge extending over the
                        lake. The numerous batde-scars on his skin gleamed in the shimmering reflected light of the
                        waters. Shiva remembered well his carefree childhood days. He had perfected the art of
                        throwing pebbles that bounced off the surface of the lake. He still held the record in his tribe for
                        the highest number of bounces: seventeen.
                        On a normal day, Shiva would have smiled at the memory from a cheerful past that had
                        been overwhelmed by the angst of the present. But today, he turned back towards his village
                        without any hint of joy.
                        Bhadra was alert, guarding the main entrance. Shiva gestured with his eyes. Bhadra turned
                        back to find his two back-up soldiers dozing against the fence. He cursed and kicked them
                        hard.
                        Shiva turned back towards the lake.
                        God bless Bhadra! At least he takes some responsibility.
                        Shiva brought the chillum made of yak-bone to his hps and took in a deep drag. Any other
                        day, the marijuana would have spread its munificence, dulling his troubled mind and letting him
                        find some moments of solace. But not today.
                        He looked left, at the edge of the lake where the soldiers of the strange foreign visitor were
                        kept under guard. With the lake behind them and twenty of Shiva’s own soldiers guarding them,
                        it was impossible for them to mount any surprise attack.
                        They let themselves be disarmed so easily. They aren’t like the bloodthirsty idiots in our land
                        who are looking for any excuse to fight.
                        The foreigner’s words came flooding back to Shiva. ‘Come to our land. It lies beyond the
                        great mountains. Others call it Meluha. I call it Heaven. It is the richest and most powerful
                        empire in India. Indeed the richest and most powerful in the whole world. Our government has
                        an offer for immigrants. You will be given fertile land and resources for farming. Today, your
                        tribe, the Gunas, fight for survival in this rough, arid land. Meluha offers you a lifestyle beyond
                        your wildest dreams. We ask for nothing in return. Just live in peace, pay your taxes and follow
                        the laws of the land.’Downloaded from https://www.studycrux.com
                        Shiva mused that he would certainly not be a chief in this new land.
                        Would I really miss that so much?
                        His tribe would have to live by the laws of the foreigners. They would have to work every
                        day for a living.
                        That’s better than fighting every day just to stay alive!
                        Shiva took another puff from his chillum. As the smoke cleared, he turned to stare at the hut
                        in the centre of his village, right next to his own, where the foreigner had been stationed. He
                        had been told that he could sleep there in comfort. In fact, Shiva wanted to keep him hostage.
                        Just in case.
                        We fight almost every month with the Pakratis just so that our village can exist next to the
                        holy lake. They are getting stronger every year, forming new alliances with new tribes. We can
                        beat the Pakratis, but not all the mountain tribes together! By moving to Meluha, we can
                        escape this pointless violence and may be live a life of comfort. What could possibly be wrong
                        with that? Why shouldn’t we take this deal? It sounds so damn good!
                        Shiva took one last drag from the chillum before banging it on the rock, letting the ash slip
                        out and rose quickly from his perch. Brushing a few specks of ash from his bare chest, he
                        wiped his hands on his tiger skin skirt, rapidly striding to his village. Bhadra and his back-up
                        stood to attention as Shiva passed the gate. Shiva frowned and gestured for Bhadra to ease
                        up.
                        Why does he keep forgetting that he has been my closestfriend since childhood? My
                        becoming the chief hasn’t really changed anything. He doesn’t need to behave unnecessarily
                        servile in front of others.
                        The huts in Shiva’s village were luxurious compared to others in their land. A grown man
                        could actually stand upright in them. The shelter could withstand the harsh mountain winds for
                        nearly three years before surrendering to the elements. He flung the empty chillum into his hut
                        as he strode to the hut where the visitor lay sleeping soundly.
                        Either he doesn’t realise he is a hostage. Or he genuinely believes that good behaviour
                        begets good behaviour.
                        Shiva remembered what his uncle, also his Guru, used to say. ‘People do what their society
                        rewards them to do. If the society rewards trust, people will be trusting.’
                        Meluha must he a trusting society if it teaches even its soldiers to expect the best in
                        strangers.
                        Shiva scratched his shaggy beard as he stared hard at the visitor.
                        He had said his name was Nandi.
                        The Meluhan’s massive proportions appeared even more enormous as he sprawled on the
                        floor in his stupor, his immense belly jiggling with every breath. Despite being obese, his skin
                        was taut and toned. His child-like face looked even more innocent asleep, with his mouth half
                        open.
                        Is this the man who will lead me to my destiny? Do I really have the destiny my uncle spoke
                        of?
                        ‘Your destiny is much larger than these massive mountains. But to make it come true, you
                        will have to cross these very same massive mountains.’
                        Do I deserve a good destiny? My people come first. Will they be happy in Meluha?
                        Shiva continued to stare at the sleeping Nandi. Then he heard the sound of a conch shell.
                        Pakratis!Downloaded from https://www.studycrux.com
                        ‘POSITIONS!’ screamed Shiva, as he drew his sword.
                        Nandi was up in an instant, drawing a hidden sword from his fur coat kept to the side. They
                        sprinted to the village gates. Following standard protocol, the women started rushing to the
                        village centre, carrying their children along. The men ran the other way, swords drawn.
                        ‘Bhadra! Our soldiers at the lake!’ shouted Shiva as he reached the entrance.
                        Bhadra relayed the orders and the Guna soldiers obeyed instantly. They were surprised to
                        see the Meluhans draw weapons hidden in their coats and rush to the village. The Pakratis
                        were upon them within moments.
                        It was a well-planned ambush by the Pakratis. Dusk was usually a time when the Guna
                        soldiers took time to thank their gods for a day without battle. The women did their chores by
                        the lakeside. If there was a time of weakness for the formidable Gunas, a time when they
                        weren’t a fearsome martial clan, but just another mountain tribe trying to survive in a tough,
                        hostile land, this was it.
                        But fate was against the Pakratis yet again. Thanks to the foreign presence, Shiva had
                        ordered the Gunas to remain alert. Thus they were forewarned and the Pakratis lost the
                        element of surprise. The presence of the Meluhans was also decisive, turning the tide of the
                        short, brutal battle in favour of the Gunas. The Pakratis had to retreat.
                        Bloodied and scarred, Shiva surveyed the damage at the end of the battle. Two Guna
                        soldiers had succumbed to their injuries. They would be honoured as clan heroes. But even
                        worse, the warning had come too late for at least ten Guna women and children. Their
                        mutilated bodies were found next to the lake. The losses were high.
                        Bastards They kill women and children when they can’t beat us!
                        A livid Shiva called the entire tribe to the centre of the village. His mind was made.
                        ‘This land is fit for barbarians! We have fought pointless battles with no end in sight. You
                        know my uncle tried to make peace, even offering access to the lake shore to the mountain
                        tribes. But these scum mistook our desire for peace as weakness. We all know what followed!’
                        The Gunas, despite being used to the brutality of regular battle, were shell-shocked by the
                        viciousness of the attack on the women and children.
                        ‘I keep nothing secret from you. All of you know the invitation of the foreigners,’ continued
                        Shiva, pointing to Nandi and the Meluhans. ‘They fought shoulder-to-shoulder with us today.
                        They have earned my trust. I want to go with them to Meluha. But this cannot be my decision
                        alone.’
                        ‘You are our chief, Shiva,’ said Bhadra. ‘Your decision is our decision. That is the tradition.’
                        ‘Not this time,’ said Shiva holding out his hand. ‘This will change our lives completely. I
                        believe the change will be for the better. Anything will be better than the pointlessness of the
                        violence we face daily. I have told you what I want to do. But the choice to go or not is yours.
                        Let the Gunas speak. This time, I follow you.’
                        The Gunas were clear on their tradition. But the respect for Shiva was not just based on
                        convention, but also on his character. He had led the Gunas to their greatest military victories
                        through his genius and sheer personal bravery.
                        They spoke in one voice. ‘Your decision is our decision"""),
